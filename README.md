## 🤔 Ojectives

We want to work on Steam public data, namely the time series of player count per game, per category, and other different metrics. Our goal will be to highlight player engagement toward game genres over time. We think it would be interesting if we know which game or genre is the most popular over time. We also used different data-viz features to investigate the popularity and market performance of game studios and their games.
